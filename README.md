## 🚀 Deployment

This project uses automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions:

1. **Automatic Deployment** - On every push to `master`, the site is automatically deployed to S3
2. **Semantic Versioning** - Releases are automatically generated based on commit messages
3. **Changelog Generation** - `CHANGELOG.md` is automatically updated with each release

## 📊 Analytics

The website tracks the following metrics using AWS DynamoDB:

- **Page Views** - Total visits to the portfolio
- **Resume Downloads** - Number of times the resume has been downloaded

Data is collected via JavaScript and sent to DynamoDB through AWS API.
